## INTRODUCTION
The **NHS Blood Stocks Management Scheme (BSMS)** aims to enhance blood inventory management across the supply chain. This project utilizes Power BI to analyze hospital component issues and wastage trends, focusing on Red Blood Cells, Platelets, and Frozen Plasma. Key insights reveal strong issue-wastage correlations, seasonal patterns, and major wastage causes like Time Expiry (TIMEX). The findings offer data-driven recommendations to optimize inventory management and minimize wastage for NHSBT BSMS.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Hospitals face challenges in managing blood component inventory, leading to high wastage and supply inefficiencies.
## AIM OF THE PROJECT
- To identify trends and correlations to optimize inventory management
and reduce wastage.
## METHODOLOGY 
- **Business Understanding:** Defined project objectives to analyze trends in hospital
component issues and wastage.
- **Data Understanding:** Explored the dataset to identify key features and
relationships for analysis.

- **ETL Process:** Extracted, transformed, and loaded the data into Power BI for
compatibility and analysis.

- **Data Modeling:** Created relationships between fact and dimension tables for
structured analysis.

- **Analysis & Visualization:** Used Power BI to generate trendline charts and
visualizations, uncovering correlations and patterns in issues and wastage.
