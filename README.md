## INTRODUCTION
The **NHS Blood Stocks Management Scheme (BSMS)** aims to enhance blood inventory management across the supply chain. This project utilizes Power BI to analyze hospital component issues and wastage trends, focusing on Red Blood Cells, Platelets, and Frozen Plasma. Key insights reveal strong issue-wastage correlations, seasonal patterns, and major wastage causes like Time Expiry (TIMEX). The findings offer data-driven recommendations to optimize inventory management and minimize wastage for NHSBT BSMS.
