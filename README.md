## INTRODUCTION
The **NHS Blood Stocks Management Scheme (BSMS)** aims to enhance blood inventory management across the supply chain. This project utilizes Power BI to analyze hospital component issues and wastage trends, focusing on Red Blood Cells, Platelets, and Frozen Plasma. Key insights reveal strong issue-wastage correlations, seasonal patterns, and major wastage causes like Time Expiry (TIMEX). The findings offer data-driven recommendations to optimize inventory management and minimize wastage for NHSBT BSMS.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Hospitals face challenges in managing blood component inventory, leading to high wastage and supply inefficiencies.
## AIM OF THE PROJECT
- **Analyze Trends:** Identify patterns in hospital component issues and wastage using Power BI to understand their correlation and root causes.
- **Optimize Inventory Management:** Provide data-driven insights to reduce wastage, especially from Time Expiry (TIMEX), and improve blood supply efficiency.
- **Enhance Decision-Making:** Support NHSBT BSMS with strategic recommendations for better forecasting, allocation, and utilization of blood components.

## METHODOLOGY 
- **Business Understanding:** I defined project objectives to analyze trends in NHS hospital
component issues and wastage.
- **Data Understanding:** I explored the dataset to identify key features and
relationships for analysis.

- **ETL Process:** I extracted, transformed, and loaded the data into Power BI for
compatibility and analysis.

- **Data Modeling:** I created relationships between fact and dimension tables for
structured analysis.

- **Analysis & Visualization:** I used Power BI to generate trendline charts and
visualizations, uncovering correlations and patterns in issues and wastage.

## MODELLING
The data modeling for this project follows a star schema approach, where the **Fact Table** (containing hospital component issues and wastage records) is connected to multiple **Dimension Tables** to ensure efficient analysis. The **Fact Table** includes key metrics such as issue counts, wastage counts, product group names, and blood group names. It is linked to **Dimension Tables** like **Blood Group (O-, A+, etc.), Calender (Year, Quarter, Month), and Wastage Codes (TIMEX, TTMH, etc.)** through unique identifiers. This relational structure allows for seamless trend analysis, comparisons across different categories, and deeper insights into the root causes of wastage and inventory inefficiencies.

## Data Analysis
### Line Chart
This chart reveals a strong correlation between hospital component issues and wastage, with both following similar yearly trends. Whenever component issues increase, wastage also rises proportionally. Notably, 2023 recorded the highest levels of both issues and wastage compared to previous years (2022 and 2023), indicating a need for improved inventory management strategies.

A quarterly analysis of the correlation between component issues and wastage reveals distinct trends. In 2022, component issues peaked in Q2 before declining in Q3, while wastage followed a similar downward trend. However, in 2023, wastage exhibited a sharp upward trend from Q1 to Q3, surpassing component issues, particularly between Q2 and Q3. A deeper dive into monthly patterns suggests seasonality, with high component issues and low wastage observed in May (Q2) and August (Q3) of 2022. Conversely, in 2023, wastage peaked in September (Q3) while component issues remained relatively low.

An analysis of component issue trends by product group reveals that Red Blood Cell (RBC) issues remained consistently high throughout the three-year period (2022â€“2024), significantly surpassing other components. Platelet (PLT) issues ranked second, while Pooled Cryo recorded the lowest issue volumes across all years.

An analysis of component issue trends by product group reveals display that Platelet wastage exhibited a consistent upward trend from Q4 2022 to Q4 2023, while component issues fluctuated across the quarters.
